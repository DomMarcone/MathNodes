#MathNodes#

MathNodes is a simple C++ math expression parser. It's node structure is designed for quick, repetetive calculations of floating point numbers.

Please refer to [MathNodesTest.cpp](test/MathNodesTest.cpp) as it's designed to be the simplest example on how to add external variables, and functions. It also contains an infinite loop, with an exit funciton added to the MathNodeBuilder object.
